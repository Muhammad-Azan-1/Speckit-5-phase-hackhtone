# PHR: Todo API Endpoints Specification

## Prompt

```
now we need to implment the REST API endpoints that backend will provide frontend to call them for adding data in database so we need to write a specification for CURD operations . Implement core APIs - Create the essential API endpoints for the todo application (CRUD operations for tasks) ultrathink
```

## Response

I have successfully created a specification for the todo API endpoints with CRUD operations. Here's what was accomplished:

### **Feature Specification Created:**
- **Feature Name**: Todo API Endpoints
- **Specification Path**: `specs/features/002-todo-api-endpoints/spec.md`
- **Checklist Path**: `specs/features/002-todo-api-endpoints/checklists/requirements.md`

### **Key Accomplishments:**
1. **Created comprehensive user stories** covering all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2. **Defined clear functional requirements** for each operation
3. **Established measurable success criteria** for performance and reliability
4. **Identified key entities** involved in the system
5. **Addressed edge cases** for security and error handling

### **Specification Coverage:**
- User Story 1: Create New Task (P1 priority)
- User Story 2: Read Tasks (P1 priority)
- User Story 3: Update Task (P1 priority)
- User Story 4: Delete Task (P1 priority)
- Functional Requirements: 10 comprehensive requirements covering all CRUD operations
- Success Criteria: 6 measurable outcomes

### **Ready for Next Phase:**
The specification is now ready for the next phase. You can proceed with `/sp.clarify` to get any additional clarifications if needed, or `/sp.plan` to generate an implementation plan.

The specification follows the project constitution guidelines and is aligned with the principles outlined in the project documentation.
