# PHR: uv-fastapi-backend Tasks

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

I have successfully generated a comprehensive task list for the backend development environment setup. Here's what was accomplished:

### **Task List Created:**
- **Feature**: Backend Development Environment Setup
- **Tasks Path**: `specs/features/uv-fastapi-backend/tasks.md`
- **Total Tasks**: 48 specific, actionable tasks

### **Key Accomplishments:**
1. **Organized by User Stories**: Tasks organized according to the 3 user stories from the specification (P1, P1, P2 priorities)
2. **Phased Approach**: Tasks divided into logical phases (Setup, Foundational, User Stories, Database, Authentication, Polish)
3. **Checklist Format**: All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and descriptions
4. **Parallel Execution Opportunities**: Identified tasks that can run in parallel to optimize development time
5. **Dependencies Mapped**: Clear dependency relationships and execution order documented
6. **MVP Scope Defined**: Clear minimum viable product scope identified (Phases 1-3)

### **Task Distribution:**
- Phase 1 (Setup): 5 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 13 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1 - Initialize Backend Project): 6 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2 - Web Framework): 6 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3 - Dev Environment): 5 tasks
- Phase 6 (Database Integration): 5 tasks
- Phase 7 (Authentication): 5 tasks
- Phase 8 (Polish): 8 tasks

### **Ready for Execution:**
The task list is now ready for execution. Each task is specific enough that an LLM or developer can complete it without additional context. The tasks follow the required checklist format and align with the specification requirements.
