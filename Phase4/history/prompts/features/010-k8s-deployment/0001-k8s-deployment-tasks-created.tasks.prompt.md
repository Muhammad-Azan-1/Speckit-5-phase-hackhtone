# K8s Deployment Tasks Created

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

Created comprehensive tasks.md file for the Kubernetes deployment feature (010-k8s-deployment) with 70+ detailed tasks organized into 6 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup Tasks - Environment preparation
2. Phase 2: Foundational Components - Kubernetes manifests
3. Phase 3: [US1] Deploy Application to Kubernetes - Core deployment
4. Phase 4: [US2] Configure Helm Charts - Packaging and configuration
5. Phase 5: [US3] Set up AI-assisted DevOps Tools - kubectl-ai and kagent
6. Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns - Documentation and finalization

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and parallelization markers. Each task is specific enough for an LLM to implement without additional context while maintaining traceability to the original specification requirements.
